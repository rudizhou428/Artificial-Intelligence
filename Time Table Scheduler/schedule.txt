?- Start is cputime, solve(L), End is cputime, Time is End - Start.
Start = 3.687
L = [14, 12, 12, 13, 11, 12, 11]
End = 3.687
Time = 0.0
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.09s cpu)


We started this question by first guessing the value of PHL250 since there are no other PHL courses. After that
we apply constraint (B) to it since we know for a fact PHL250 has to start on the first day (dec 11). After that we
guess the value of all of the MAT courses saving MAT140 last and applying constraint (B). We do this because we know that
MATH 140 cannot be scheduled to last day (dec 14), but can be any of the other 3 days and we might need to backtrack to this guess a couple of times 
to fufill the other constraint requirements. However each time we guess a MAT course we need to apply constraint (C) to each course 
to make sure the are ordered from least to greatest by course number after we succesfully pick values for them. After that we do the same for the CSC courses and
again apply constraint (C). At this point both constraint (C) and (B) are satisfied and we just apply constraint (A) at the end to finish it off.
